# Hypedown Theme

**Hypedown** is a calm, low-noise dark theme for Visual Studio Code, designed for long coding sessions with a strong focus on **TypeScript, React, and JSX/TSX readability**.

It avoids over-saturation, rainbow syntax, and harsh contrast in favor of balance, clarity, and scanability.

## Why Hypedown?

Most dark themes fall into one of two traps:
- Too flat and lifeless
- Too colorful and distracting

Hypedown sits in the middle.

### Design goals
- Reduce visual fatigue during long sessions
- Keep structure obvious without shouting
- Make TypeScript and JSX easy to scan
- Calm UI chrome so code stays the focus

If you like Vim-inspired palettes but want something tuned for modern frontend work, this is for you.

## Variants

### **Hypedown**
The default variant. Balanced contrast for general use across JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and more.

### **Hypedown TS**
A TypeScript-focused variant with enhanced emphasis for:
- Types & interfaces
- Enums and decorators
- Default library symbols
- JSX / TSX structure

Recommended if you spend most of your day in React or TypeScript-heavy codebases.

---

## Language Support (tuned explicitly for)
- TypeScript / TSX
- JavaScript / JSX
- React
- HTML / CSS / SCSS
- JSON / Markdown

Semantic token highlighting is enabled for improved clarity where supported.

## Philosophy

Hypedown is intentionally opinionated.

- No neon
- No excessive italics
- No rainbow punctuation
- No visual clutter

Just enough contrast to stay readable without becoming noisy.
