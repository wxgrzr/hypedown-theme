# Hyperdark

A low contrast, mellow dark theme for VS Code with a muted color palette.

**Important:** This theme was made to suit my own preferences. I am not a professional theme developer so there may be some issues. However, I don't plan to maintain this much. Use at your own discretion.

## Philosophy:

**I wanted:**

- No neon or bright colors
- No excessive italics
- No rainbow punctuation, brackets, or indents
- No visual clutter

**It needed to:**

- Remain aesthetically pleasing without impacting the quality of syntactical information
- Written for typescript / react development
- Easy to use for long coding sessions without strain
